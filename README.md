# Garbage_Classification
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify waste into categories (e.g., organic, recyclable, hazardous, etc.) to support smarter waste management and sustainability. The model is trained on image data and leverages deep learning (EfficientNet/RNNs) for accurate classification.
